<article>

	<p>Sushi is one of the best cooking preparations and one my friends always ask me to make.</p>
	<p>Sushi is a typical dish of Japanese origin based on rice seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt and combined with other ingredients such as raw fish, shellfish, vegetables, etc. This dish is one of the most recognized in Japanese cuisine and one of the most popular internationally. Today sushi is a dish that is well known around the world, many people prepare it, and in certain countries, they adapt it to different cultures, adding ingredients from each place. In many parts of the world, it is considered an authentic delicacy as a luxury dish since it is established that it is only prepared with products of the highest quality. In many countries, Japanese restaurants specializing in sushi have begun to spread. That is due not only to its taste but also because it is an excellent option for people who want to keep their weight under control. Since it provides few calories, is low in fat, and offers large amounts of vitamin B, which improves blood circulation. It is identified as being a very healthy type of food. Precisely for this reason, it may be one of those responsible for the population in Japan having long-lasting longevity. Also, this is why we cannot ignore the fact that, according to the statistics, the aforementioned Asian country is not only the one with the fewest cases of colon cancer in the world but also the one that holds the records of the elderly with the highest age.</p>

	<div id="pullquote">The fine art of preparing sushi is something that you watch and learn.</div>
	
	<p>Although sushi is usually associated with fish and shellfish, it can also have vegetables, eggs, or other accompaniments. In addition, the traditional fresh products accompanying the rice can be something other than raw. Also included are roasted, boiled, fried, or marinated preparations. There is a wide variety of options in sushi. The most popular one is made with edible seaweed called nori: the rice and the rest of the ingredients are wrapped in the seaweed and rolled up. Beyond the ingredients used in preparing sushi, the condiments and dressings are very important and define a large part of the dish. Soy sauce, wasabi, and so-called sweet and sour sauce are very popular. It is considered that the best sushi in the world is eaten in a restaurant located on the Tokyo subway, specifically in the Ginza station. It is an establishment called Sukiyabashi Jiro Honten, where eating twenty pieces costs 300 euros and where there are months of waiting lists because it only fits ten people.</p>

	<p>If we think about it this way, sushi is essentially easy to prepare since it does not require any ingredient to have a very complex prior preparation. Only the rice and certain meats must be marinated before the initial preparation. Having the rice ready, we only have to take care of cutting our ingredients into sticks to be able to put ourselves inside the roll. For a long time, I thought sushi was challenging to prepare, mainly because its price is usually high and because I often heard people say that they had tried and failed. In Chile, which is my country of origin, there are great sushi preparations, and the prices are high, but when I moved to Miami, I realized that they are even higher here, which was a disappointment for me since I really like eating sushi. That is why I decided to learn how to prepare my own sushi so I wouldn't have to depend on a place to go to buy them, and I could prepare them in the comfort of my home. One day I decided, and I bought a kit on Amazon with the essential utensils for sushi which were: Makisu (it is a rolling bamboo and cotton mat), two wooden paddles, and sushi chopsticks. I went to the supermarket and bought all the necessary ingredients that I like inside the sushi, but above all, the most important thing I bought the rice for sushi that is different from regular rice since it is a short grain. When I had all my ingredients, I began watching videos on YouTube of different people who teach how to prepare sushi, from preparing the rice to cutting the ingredients, and that is how I started to practice. My first attempts were not the best rolls that existed, but I learned the rolling technique little by little and managed to make them strong so that they won't break. Then one day, I organized a meeting with my friends and prepared sushi for them.</p>
	<p>Since that day, we always get together one day of the month to cook sushi, since from the first time, they were fascinated and everyone wanted to learn how to cook sushi. Several of my friends know how to cook sushi because of me, and it becomes easier since we all put them together and then enjoy them.</p>
